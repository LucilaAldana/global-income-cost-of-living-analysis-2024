This project analyzes global income and cost of living trends (2024, USD) to evaluate affordability, purchasing power, and financial stability across countries. The analysis was developed for a relocation and financial advisory scenario aimed at helping expatriates, digital nomads, and investors make data-driven decisions.

Using data from Numbeo, the project compares income levels, essential living expenses (rent, utilities, food, transportation), and non-essential spending categories to assess overall affordability. A Disposable Income Ratio was used as the primary KPI to measure how much income remains after covering basic living costs.

Countries were classified into three affordability tiers:

• Affordable (20%+ disposable income)

• Moderately affordable (10–19%)

• Unaffordable (<10%)

The analysis also explores 10-year trends to evaluate economic stability and long-term financial planning viability, highlighting post-COVID income volatility, purchasing power shifts, and resilience patterns.

Key findings reveal that while essential goods consistently represent 70–80% of living costs across most developed economies, differences in income stability significantly impact long-term affordability. Countries such as Switzerland and Germany demonstrate strong income-cost alignment and stability, while others show higher volatility or narrow income margins.

The project concludes with country recommendations tailored to different personas:

• Digital Nomads (moderate rent + stability)

• Long-term Expats (income predictability)

• Investors (consumer purchasing resilience)

This analysis simulates a macroeconomic decision-support scenario focused on affordability benchmarking and financial feasibility evaluation.
